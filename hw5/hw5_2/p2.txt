// Write your answer to Problem 2 (b) and (c) here

B.) Examining the program we can see that if a 'real' branch predictor, i.e. not a simple predict not taken, had been used
it might have been able to identify the pattern that was present, that is branch every other. A more sophisticated
branch predictor is able to help reduce the loss of cycles due to branching. The program that we wrote executed on our
processor will get every other branch wrong because it always continues on until if finds out it was wrong. This is 
very different when compared to a more progressive branch predictor which might have been able to get the pattern and thus
reduce branch mis-predicts.

C.) The act of predicting a branch should always take one cycle. Otherwise you will end up delaying your processor whenever
a branch is encountered, which at that point the predictor useless because it will be causing more harm then good. If we examine
the result of a branch predictor the penalaty of a miss-predict is always a looming threat because it can be quite severe depending 
on how you implemented your branch logic and branch predictor.
